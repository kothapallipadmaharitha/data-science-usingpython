*DEFINITION OF PYTHON LANGUAGE
 >Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
 >created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
 >An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably          
  whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords).
 >And a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in      languages such as C++ or Java. 
 >It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.

*FEATURES OF PYTHON LANGUAGE
 >Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. 
 >It supports 
   -multiple programming paradigms, 
   -including object-oriented, 
   -imperative, 
   -functional and    
   -procedural, and 
   -has a large and comprehensive standard library.

*ADVANTAGES OF PYTHON LANGUAGE
 >Python's syntax is easy to learn.
 >So both non-programmers and programmers can start programming right away. 
 > Most modern programming languages are object-oriented (such as Java, C++, and C#) or have support for OOP features (such as Perl version 5 and later).
